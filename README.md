# FOCIUM — RING-CORE Orb Prototype

This is a minimal prototype for the `RING-CORE` orbital visual used in FOCIUM.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# 1) install dependencies
npm install

# 2) run dev server
npm run dev

# Open the printed local URL in your browser (http://localhost:5173)
```

What this includes:
- Vite + React
- @react-three/fiber scene with a shader-based orb

Next steps I can do for you:
- Tune the shader for more liquid fractal motion
- Add UI overlay, onboarding animation, chimes and TTS hooks
- Export short demo video or GIF for presentation
